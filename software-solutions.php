                  <p>
                    This is a customer communication management platform which integrates with corporate core systems to generate secure customer communication. The communication could be in the form of statements, letters, notices, policies, etc. Data in an encrypted form is an input to the application and the system generates processed output which is based on defined layouts, business needs, demographics and geographic conditions.  Output is generated for print, email, web and mobile.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The application is robust enough to handle huge amounts of data to be processed across multiple output formats. A unique feature of this product is that it allows remote vendor access, which enables multiple vendors to generate outputs across a common layout system.

                    A very crucial requirement for most organisations is that a communication that has been generated for a customer reaches that customer. Thus, tracking that communication becomes equally important. Today, there are some courier agencies that provide such features basis a portal access. Some emailing engines provide feedback basis an email that a customer receives. However, there is no single system that provides the corporate a single-window view of the various communications that are sent to a customer across multiple mediums, be it in the print or email format.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Deliverables Logistics Management System (DLMS) is our product that solves this very problem. It provides the organisation a single window for tracking and tracing a communication that is sent out to a customer. It integrates multiple core systems at the organisational level as well as brings into play multiple vendor systems to provide.

                  <p>
                    iOMS is an inventory management system developed by Seshaasai to control, track and manage secured and non-secured products from indenting to consumption. A product with a unique reference is prepared or procured from vendors. This product is dispatched to the branches from the central or regional hub, which when received is reconciled and acknowledged. At the branch, the product is either used internally or given to field officers for further issuance to the customer. This system tracks this entire journey of the product basis the unique reference number assigned to it. On reaching a minimum threshold, the system computes and generates a reorder list which is put for approval using a pre-configured approval matrix.
