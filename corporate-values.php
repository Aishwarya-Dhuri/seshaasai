          "All wealth belongs to the Divine and those who hold it are trustees, not possessors. It is with them today. Tomorrow it may be elsewhere. It all depends on the way they discharge their trust while it is with them, in what spirit, with what consciousness in their use of it, to what purpose."

          A pixel is the smallest, simplest and unchanging element in a digital world. It is constant, singular and yet packed with possibilities. Everything we do is guided by the pixel — our unswerving commitment to staying rooted and yet doing the right thing for our clients, our people, and our community. As the pixel takes on various colours and comes together to make the big picture, we also believe that staying true to our essence, and serving clients with that, takes us closer to our goals.
